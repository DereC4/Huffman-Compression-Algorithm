Observations:
All the files experienced compressions that reduced the size with files under 100,000 size taking less than 1 second on
average. This is because the files were mostly large in size and thus it was likely they had repeated characters and words
 such as in the "book1" file containing a story. The letter "e" would be repeated many times because this is a common
 letter and thus it would be compressed to a large frequency and save storage space. However, when we removed the hf
 compression and compressed again, most of the previously compressed hf files experienced little to no compression.

What kinds of file lead to lots of compressions?
The bigger files with more of the similar characters led to more compression. For example, a file with just "e" multiple
times will be compressed to a very small size as we simply store one character and its frequency.

What kind of files had little or no compression?
Files that were smaller had less compression. This may have been because there were less frequencies present just due
to the fact that the file contents were fewer and thus there would have been more unique elements with small frequency
values.

What happens when you try and compress a huffman code file?
When compressing a huffman code file, it compresses the compressed data and depending on the file size makes the new
file smaller but not by much since the values are already compressed. This could be reversed as I found out,
reverting it to its original size.
