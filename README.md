Proof-of-concept Huffman coding implementation with GUI interface. Educational project completed for UT Austin CS 314 (Mike Scott). Tested on various media files including cat memes and video files.

## Features

- Huffman encoding and decoding
- GUI interface for compression/decompression operations
- Supports binary files (images, videos, etc.)
